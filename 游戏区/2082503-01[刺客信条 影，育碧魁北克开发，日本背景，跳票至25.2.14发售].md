刺客信条品牌总监marc-alexis cote近日的采访，摘一点个人觉得爆典的言论，包括“刺客信条系列一直都寻求探索多元化视角的历史”、“弥助在日本历史真实人物”、“刺客信条不仅仅是游戏，也是一个影响思考的平台”、“民主会因为好人沉默而消逝”......全文链接也可移步查阅。

个人感觉如果游戏制作人都是这样想的，那就真的不能怪玩家不把你的游戏当游戏看了。 <blockquote>Assassin's Creed has always been about exploring the full spectrum of human history, and by its very nature, <strong>that history is diverse</strong>. <strong>Staying true to history means embracing the richness of human perspectives - without compromise</strong>. For example, in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we highlight figures, both fictional like Naoe, a Japanese woman warrior, <strong>and historical, like Yasuke, the African born samurai</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>But just as Yasuke's presence in Japanese history is fact</strong>, so too are the stories of women who defied societal expectations and took up arms in times of conflict</blockquote><blockquote>Assassin's Creed is <strong>more than just a game</strong>. <strong>It can be a platform for meaningful exploration and reflection wrapped in the excitement of unforgettable gameplay</strong>, and it is that fusion of creativity, diversity, immersion and fun that continues to define the franchise and connect it with players around the globe.</blockquote><blockquote>As the authors of 'How Democracies Die' so powerfully stated, <strong>democracies crumble when good people decide to stay silent</strong>. The same is true, I think, of our creative freedom when we allow fear to stifle our voices. When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away. We cannot let that happen. <strong>It's time for us as creators to stand firm on our commitment to our values, by telling stories that inspire, that challenge and that help people connect</strong>. Our silence cannot become complicit.</blockquote>
